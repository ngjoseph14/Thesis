# Thesis

Contains the code used to obtain the results in the report!

To run the SpanishData files the Altera dataset would be required to be in the same file as the code. However the Altera measured dataset was not included in this github repository due to the repository being for public access. I don't have the permissions to give this data to anyone so therefore it was not included.

To run the CSIRData files the CSIR dataset would be required to be in the same file as the code. However the CSIR measured dataset was not included in this github repository due to the repository being for public access. I don't have the permissions to give this data to anyone so therefore it was not included.
