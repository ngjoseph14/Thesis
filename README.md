# Thesis

Contains the code used to obtain the results in the report!

To run the SpanishData files the Altera dataset would be required to be in the same file as the code. However the Altera measured dataset was not included in this github repository due to the repository being for public access. I don't have the permissions to give this data to anyone so therefore it was not included.

To run the CSIRData files the CSIR dataset would be required to be in the same file as the code. However the CSIR measured dataset was not included in this github repository due to the repository being for public access. I don't have the permissions to give this data to anyone so therefore it was not included.

All files can be run as is, but in the CSIRData code files, the HRR profiles selected in the loading of the data can be changed. This will reduce the computation time. The range profiles used to produce the ISAR images in the thesis have been indicated in the comments above the line of code for this step.
